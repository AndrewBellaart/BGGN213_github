```{r}
string <- c("10", "100", 1)
as.numeric(string) + 1
```

# However, this method doesn't work with numerics with commas, like 1,000.
# gsub() function will replace every occurance of the character. sub() will only replace the first occurance.

# Using Mol* to examine HIV-Pr

Here is a shitty picture of HIV-Pr that is not very useful yet.

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The resolution is 2 angstroms, which is not enough to show the hydrogen atoms.


> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH308


> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues?
